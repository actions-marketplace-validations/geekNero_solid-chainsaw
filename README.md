Cyclone/cdxgen is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) tool that helps generate accurate and comprehensive SBOMs for software projects. It analyzes the dependencies and components used in a project and creates a detailed inventory of all the software components, including their versions and licenses.

With Cyclone/cdxgen, you can easily track and manage the open source components and third-party libraries used in your project. It provides a clear and structured representation of the software supply chain, enabling you to identify any potential security vulnerabilities or license compliance issues.

To use Cyclone/cdxgen, simply provide the necessary input files, such as package manifests or dependency files, and it will generate an SBOM in a standardized format, such as SPDX or CycloneDX. This SBOM can then be shared with stakeholders, including customers, auditors, and security teams, to ensure transparency and facilitate risk management.

Cyclone/cdxgen is a valuable tool for organizations that prioritize software supply chain security and compliance. By leveraging SBOMs generated by Cyclone/cdxgen, you can enhance your software development processes, mitigate risks, and ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of your software supply chain.
